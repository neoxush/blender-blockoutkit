# PCG Level Blockout Toolkit for Blender

A procedural **blockout map generator** for game development. The addon turns a
single spline into a grid-aligned blockout populated with **floors, walls,
half-walls (cover), doorways, ramps, stairs and pillars** — the same vocabulary
used by Unreal modular kits, Houdini Labs Level Blockout, Synty POLYGON
Prototype packs and Unity ProBuilder. Designers iterate level flow by editing
the spline; the addon rebuilds the geometry in a deterministic multi-pass
pipeline.

## How a blockout is built

Every `Generate` produces output by running five passes in order:

| Pass | Stage | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| P1 | **Layout — Ribbon** | Place a column of cells perpendicular to the local spline tangent at every sample; each cell records its tangent yaw so it stays aligned with the road. In Road Mode the centerline column is skipped so the spline becomes the actual drivable road and only side / shoulder cells exist. |
| P2 | **Layout — Laterals** | Spawn lateral pockets controlled by `Lateral Density` & `Lateral Depth (cells)`; pockets always extend outward (away from the centerline) in the parent road cell's local frame so they inherit the road's orientation. |
| P3 | **Elevation** | Assign integer elevation steps per cell from the chosen source, smooth across neighbours |
| P4 | **Blockout — Floor / Wall / Traversal** | Place a floor tile per cell; wall, half-wall or doorway on every edge; ramp/stairs across elevation breaks. Every piece is rotated by the cell's `orientation` yaw so floors and walls follow the road tangent instead of snapping to the world axes. Edges between two corridor (`path`) cells are always kept open so the road never gets fenced in, regardless of style. |
| P5 | **Decoration** | Run the user-defined Layer system (Edge Loop / Fill Grid / Scatter / Center Line) on top of the blockout. Each layer has a `Target Cells` filter (default `Off-Road`) so decoration props skip the spline corridor by default. |

The pipeline is driven by one master switch — **Blockout Style** — which changes
how every later pass interprets its parameters.

## Blockout Styles

### Outdoor / Open (default)
- Cells become **open platforms**, not enclosed rooms
- Walls only appear at world boundaries; elevation drops get **cover half-walls** (`Cover Density`)
- Doorways are not emitted (open boundaries between connected cells)
- Best for **parkour, urban streets, outdoor combat zones**
- Default elevation source: **Follow Spline Z** — terrain follows the curve you draw

### Indoor / Dungeon
- Cells become **enclosed rooms** with **full perimeter walls**
- Where two connected cells share elevation, the wall is replaced by a **Doorway** piece
- Where elevation differs, a **Ramp** (or **Stairs** if enabled) spans the gap
- `Lateral Density` controls how many neighbour pairs stay sealed
- Best for **dungeons, interiors, base layouts**
- Default elevation source: **Random + Smooth** — produces varied vertical interiors

## Placeholder piece library

| Piece | Role | Default primitive |
|---|---|---|
| `FLOOR` | One per cell, sits at the cell's elevated Z | Thin tile, `grid_size × grid_size` |
| `WALL` | Full-height solid on a missing or sealed edge | `grid_size` long × thin × `wall_height` |
| `WALL_HALF` | Cover / parapet on drop edges (Outdoor) | ~45% wall height |
| `DOORWAY` | Frame with cut-out opening (Indoor connections) | Two posts + lintel |
| `RAMP` | Wedge across an elevation step | Width = `grid_size`, run = `ramp_slope_cells × grid_size`, rise = step delta |
| `STAIRS` | Stepped variant of ramp | Configurable step count |
| `PILLAR` | Optional corner column | Slim square column |

Each piece type has a **Collection override** slot in the *Blockout Pieces*
panel — drop a Blender Collection containing your custom modular assets and
the addon spawns those instead of the primitive. Mix and match: override walls
with your modular wall kit while keeping primitive floors, etc.

## Viewport Panel Guide

All controls live in `View3D > Sidebar > PCG Blockout` (`N` panel).

### 1. Spline Path
Defines the level's path. Use **Create Default Spline** for a flat, twist-protected 2-point Bezier optimised for linear layouts.

### 2. Blockout Style
The top-level switch between **Outdoor / Open** and **Indoor / Dungeon** styles described above. Every downstream pass branches on this value.

### 3. Layout Grid
* **Grid Size**: footprint of a single cell (default 4m). All pieces snap to this grid.
* **Spacing**: spline sample interval (smaller = denser corridor).
* **Path Width (cells)** / **Lateral Depth (cells)**: integer cell counts that control corridor breadth and how far lateral pockets reach.
* **Lateral Density** / **Size Variation**: control random pocket spawn frequency and depth variance.
* **Road Mode**: clears the centerline so the spline becomes a road and cells appear only on the sides (`Left`/`Right`/`Both`/`Alternating`).

> **Road continuity guarantee.** Every edge between two corridor cells (cells flagged `role=path`) is forced open by the layout pass and skipped by the wall pass. That means walls, half-walls, doorways and cover parapets will never be dropped in the middle of the spline corridor, even at elevation breaks (ramps/stairs still spawn) or in indoor mode where neighbour pairs may otherwise be sealed by `Lateral Density`. Side / lateral cells are still decorated normally, so the road can have walled rooms or cover walls flanking it without blocking through-traffic.

> **Tangent-aligned ribbon.** Path cells are placed in continuous world space along the spline's local tangent / normal frame -- not on the global grid -- and every floor, wall, doorway, ramp and pillar is rotated by the cell's tangent yaw. A diagonal or curved spline produces a clean diagonal/curved road instead of a stair-stepped staircase of axis-aligned blocks.

### 4. Elevation
* **Source**: `Flat`, `Random + Smooth`, or `Follow Spline Z`.
* **Step Height**: vertical size of one step.
* **Max Steps**: cap on how many steps a cell can rise.
* **Smoothing Passes**: neighbour-averaging iterations (0 = jagged).
* Where neighbouring cells differ by ≥ 1 step a **Ramp / Stairs** is automatically inserted.

### 5. Blockout Pieces
* **Wall Height**, **Ramp Length**, **Cover Density** sliders.
* **Use Stairs Instead of Ramps**, **Generate Pillars** toggles.
* **Piece Library** grid: per-piece **enable toggle + asset collection override** slot.

### 6. Decoration Layers (post-blockout)
The classic layer system from v1 — runs **after** the blockout is built so user-supplied props are layered on top of the structural pieces.
* **Rule**: `Edge Loop` / `Fill Grid` / `Scatter` / `Center Line`.
* **Target Cells**: which cells the layer is allowed to populate. Defaults to `Off-Road` so decoration props never end up obstructing the spline corridor; switch to `Road Only` for lane markings / manholes / road decals, `Lateral Only` for side-pocket dressing, or `All Cells` for the legacy behaviour. Existing presets without this field migrate to `Off-Road` automatically.
* **Asset Collection**: where to source mesh instances (falls back to cubes).
* **Density / Offset / Random Rotation / Random Scale**: per-layer randomisers.

### 7. Terrain *(disabled)*
The procedural ground-mesh feature has been parked: in practice it didn't reliably "hold up" the blockout the way it was originally intended, so the panel section, the generation step and the Remix toggle are all commented out. The `TerrainGenerator` class and `terrain_*` parameters remain on disk so the feature can be revived (or re-designed) later. Existing scenes load with `terrain_enabled = false` after the next regenerate.

### 8. Road Mesh
Standalone road geometry, generated independently of the terrain.

### 9. Controls & Utilities
* **Generate**: clears old output and runs the full pipeline.
* **Preview**: spawns wireframe cell tiles + edge dots (red=wall, green=open/doorway, yellow=ramp) so you can see the planned blockout before committing.
* **Remix Parameters**: randomizes the subset of parameters configured via the gear popover.
* **History popover**: stores up to 10 previous generations + named snapshots.

### 10. Presets
Save/load configurations as JSON in `presets/`. Two presets ship out of the box:
* `outdoor_street.json` — open street blockout (Outdoor style, road mode, cover walls)
* `indoor_dungeon.json` — enclosed dungeon (Indoor style, doorways + stairs + pillars)

Legacy v1 presets are auto-migrated to the v2 schema on load.
